# CSE310_Software_Portfolio

# Overview
Our goal is to learn how to use ROS to interact with the physical world and people. We want the arm to reach for a point designated by the user by touching the point. It will also respond to voice commands (turn left or right, up or down, etc.). We will be learning Open CV and speech recognition to utilize the commands mentioned earlier.

# Development Environment
The Raspberry Pi will be the brain of the project, running Robot Operating System Noetic. Python will be the main language in use. OpenCV will be used for object recognition and location. PocketSphinx will be used for voice commands (i.e. 'turn left', 'look right'...). eSpeak will be used for voice responses and status updates.
